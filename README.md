# ASL_recognizer

## What is all about

* Build a sign language recognizer. 
* Input was coordinates of hand motion. 
* Built features based on cartesian and polar coordinate systems.
* Tried various model selectors:
** log likelihood using cross-validation folds (CV)
* Trained HMM models in combination with NLP n-gram model

, Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), Discriminative Information Criterion (DIC).
WER rate was varying between 48 to 63 depending on the set of features and the model selection method.
In the optional Part 4, designed and implemented a hybrid HMM/NLP n-gram model. The final WER was 21% for a test set.
